# Project Updates - Chang (1/18/2019)

## 180719/180726 RNA-Seq Marlies Meisel
### Current Status:
  - Instructed Meisel on registering for ClueGO and IPA
    - Gave her basic insturctions on how to use the software, and let her determine which methodology is best herself
### Writing Methods and Materials
[] Will write a short paragraph about the methods and materials used during the RNA-seq analysis
    
## 180716 RNA-Seq Ava Puccio
### Current Status:
  - Uma will do Microarray Analysis via excel on Windows OS
### Troubleshooting: Salmon
[] Determine the reason for Salmons output in repeating certain gene names
  Info:
    - Does not appear to be present in other data sets, such as Lin Hang and Meisel
    - Different gene IDs do appear in the output file, however, they do end up matching with the correct gene name according to Ensembl
    - Every line has a different Ensembl ID
    - Most lines that have repeat Gene names have same CPM values throughout, but some have different values
  [x] Run a check on reference files from Salmon aligner and RStudio reference files to makes sure version numbers match
  [x] Do a re-run of edgeR using the OLD biomaRt methodology, (keeping in mind that the available reference file is POSSIBLY not fully up to date)
  [x] Check BioStars/forums to see if people ran into similar situation
  [] Check a generic gene with multiple repeats and check numCounts from the quant.sf file of Salmon (Do a similar analysis troublshooting like we did with Meisel)

## RNA-Seq Cardounel
### Current Status:
  - Waiting on RNA-Seq questionaire to continue on with analysis
### Pre-Patient 2 Samples look Strange:
  [] Running BLAST on Poly-G trimmed fasta files on Pre-patient 2 to see if there are signs of contamination via CLC Genome Browser
