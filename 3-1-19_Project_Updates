# Project Updates - Chang (3/1/2019)

## RNA-Seq Cardounel
### Current Status:
  - Discarded the idea of using picard metrics, took too long to try and set up for us and it was not very well documented if
  we came accross any problems.
  - Anish found that the output seems off.  There should not be such a high amount of 'INTERGENIC GENES' counts, so he thinks that
  there is a consistency discrepency with the reference files that I was using, since I had to use UCSC 'RefFlat.txt' file and I
  aligned the data using an ensembl GTF.
  - In the process of trying to stream-line the bash script of RNASeqMetrics so that it could be a tool for us later on without
  having to manually output to RStudio to make graphs
### Picard Metrics
  [x] There is not clearly labeled HISAT2 index using the UCSC reference fasta file, so creating my own that is clearly labeled
  [] ReMap the data using the UCSC reference files
  [] Stream line the output from RNASeqMetrics into one file so that it will be easier to create the Rscript when making the 
  graphs, so dont have to seperately put them into RStudio
  [] Make R Script to get a graphical output of the Ribosomal content,

### Current Status:
  - Waiting on response from Meisel if there are any other things she needs for the paper
