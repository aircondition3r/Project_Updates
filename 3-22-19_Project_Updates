# Project Updates - Chang (3/1/2019)

## RNA-Seq Kane
### Current Status:
  - Finished creation of DE and Master gene list, however, clustering does not look as expected and need to discuss on possible
  sample mislabelling issues
    - "Star" files for GFPhi and GFPlow do not match up with their groupings, and Sample 9 WT is not grouping with the other WT
### To DO:
  [] Figure out what is happening with Sample 9, and whether it is mislabeled with one of the other 'star' files.
    [] Check out FOXP3, see if there is a correlation between the GFP conditions vs WT and maybe correlate that with a possible
    mis-labeled star file
