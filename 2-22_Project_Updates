# Project Updates - Chang (2/22/2019)

## RNA-Seq Cardounel
### Current Status:
  - Finished running Picard's Collect RNA Seq Metrics program, however, output is not friendly when dealing with large data sets
  so found a github package that was devloped to stream line the process into a "multiRNASeqMetrics" output.  This output would be
  as easy as looking at multiqc data from Fastqc or Qorts. Package called Picard Metrics
   - https://github.com/slowkow/picardmetrics
### Picard Metrics
  [] Currently testing on HTC to get it working in out environment.  However, running into problems with directory compatiblities
  [x] Asking Anish for help in making this code compatible with HTC environment
  [] Working on R Script to get beautiful graphs as see on the GitHub page

## 180719/180726 RNA-Seq Marlies Meisel
### Current Status:
  - Waiting on response from Meisel if there are any other things she needs for the paper
