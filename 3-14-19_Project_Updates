# Project Updates - Chang (3/1/2019)

## RNA-Seq Kane
### Current Status:
  - Finally got the correct samples, and running through regular pipeline using HISAT2, and using UCSC reference files so can use
  picard tools for this project if needed.
### Pipeline
  [] Gettings some errors in the qorts output, but still outputs all of the correct plots that are expected, figure out why the
  errors are occurring
  [] Run HT-Seq
  [] Make Salmon Index for Mouse with new Salmon 11.3 parameters
  [] Run Salmon
  [] Compare HISAT2 and Salmon output
  [] edgeR

## RNA-Seq Cardounel
### Current Status:
  - Waiting on response from Cardounel on what to do with Patient Pre 2
### Picard Metrics
  - Picard Metrics is working 100% and runs within a reasonable amount of time

## 180719/180726 RNA-Seq Marlies Meisel
### Current Status:
  - Waiting on response from Meisel if there are any other things she needs for the paper
